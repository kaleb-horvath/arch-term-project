Two options of IO:

* Write a program with DIP switches and write to a user-code memory section, and then use a 'Run' routine setup by the operating system that sets up the IP/PC to the beginning of this user-code memory section. This would require the controller to read from the serial device and write the bytes incoming from the DIP switches directly to the user-mode memory??? Would require enabling lowest privilege mode? X-baud rate serial terminal?
  * The OS has some 'loop' routine that blocks on memory-mapped IO and looks for programs to put into user-code memory and then calls the Run service routine. From your program you could make use of other service routines like IO. 
  * Take input compare do math etc.
  * Virtual ROM monitor-controller that handles a terminal and output serial display.
* High level Job Control Language and possibly multi processing kernel?
* A command line interface that accepts a high-level language that is compiled down to LC3 instructions and then ran over the LC3?
